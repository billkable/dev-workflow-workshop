So that is a wrap!

You successfully:

-   Navigated a backlog and assessed a story.
-   Used *feedback loops* using *Refactoring*,
    *Test Driven Development* practices with *Red/Green/Refactor*
    technique.
-   Curated WIP tracking commits into a single well defined commit.
-   Integrated your work to a remote main branch (trunk).

These are some of the practices and techniques you may encounter on
VMware Tanzu Labs engagements.
